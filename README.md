# DC Motor Speed Control using 8051 Microcontroller
This project aims to control the speed of a DC motor using an 8051 microcontroller. The following steps are required:

## Hardware Setup
1. Create and build a motor driver circuit to regulate the direction and speed of the motor.
2. Connect the necessary pins of the 8051 microcontroller to the motor driver circuit.

## Software Implementation
1. Set up a timer or counter on the 8051 microcontroller to generate a PWM signal for motor speed control.
2. Calculate the timer settings required to achieve the desired PWM duty cycle and frequency.
3. Initialize the chosen timer or counter with the calculated settings and set it to PWM mode.
4. Implement a speed control algorithm in the microcontroller firmware to modify the PWM duty cycle based on the desired motor speed.

The PWM signal generated by the microcontroller will control the speed of the DC motor through the motor driver circuit.
